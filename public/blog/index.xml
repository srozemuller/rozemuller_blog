Many Intune administrators use a test group and Deployment Rings for this. In the case of Windows Updates, administrators configure an update ring and assign a group to it. The group is filled with devices (I call it a device group).
In this blog post, I will show you how to dynamically manage a device group in an automated way for your Intune update rings based on
a user group. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it dynamic device group management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add Windows Cloud Login application to Conditional Access automated</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/add-windows-cloud-login-application-to-ca-automated/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2024 09:28:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/add-windows-cloud-login-application-to-ca-automated/</guid><description>&lt;p>Single Sign On (SSO) for Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) gives users a seamless login experience from their Windows 10 or Windows 11 device to AVD. This feature is available for a while and most people have configured this feature already. Also, most are also using Conditional Access (CA) (I hope). To make Single Sign On work for AVD in combination with CA policies you need to add the applications &lt;code>Microsoft Remote Desktop (a4a365df-50f1-4397-bc59-1a1564b8bb9c)&lt;/code> to your CA policies. Based on your situation the applications are in- or excluded.
Now, Microsoft announced that the Single Sign On traffic will be transitioned from the &lt;code>Microsoft Remote Desktop&lt;/code> app to &lt;code>Windows Cloud Login&lt;/code>. This means you have to add this application to your CA policies. This can be done manually, but I prefer to automate this. In this blog post, I will show you how to add the &lt;code>Windows Cloud Login&lt;/code> application to your CA policies automated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graph API in automation at scale</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/graph-api-in-automation-at-scale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 11:28:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/graph-api-in-automation-at-scale/</guid><description>&lt;p>Maybe you heard of it before, Graph API.

Session host update enables you to update the underlying virtual machine (VM) image, size, disk type, and other configuration properties. It does this by deleting or deallocating the existing virtual machine and creating a new one with the updated configuration stored in the session host configuration.
I&amp;rsquo;m realy exited abou this new feature.
In this blog, I explain this new feature in how it works, where to think of when using it and, how to manage this (in an automated way).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Find specific Azure Virutal Desktop assigned user</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/find-azure-virtual-desktop-assigned-user/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 16:44:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/find-azure-virtual-desktop-assigned-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I saw a question on X (Twitter) where someone was looking for a way to filter for a specific Azure Virtual Desktop assigned user using the Azure management API. For some reason, the filter option is not working in this API. Where in the end it was not possible to find the correct user directly from an API request.
In this post, I show a different, also more efficient way, to find the correct user assigned to an Azure Virtual Desktop session host.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The IntuneCLI for automated Intune management</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/the-intunecli-for-automated-intune-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 02:44:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/the-intunecli-for-automated-intune-management/</guid><description>&lt;p>Managing Intune can be challenging, especially when having multiple Microsoft Intune environments.

Conditional Access policies are in basic if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it. Or, it requires everyone to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication can be a password in combination with an SMS or the use of the Microsoft Authenticator app for example.

Using templates makes life easier. No new information I guess. If you run tasks in DevOps, Terraform, or other engines you want to reuse code blocks. When deploying resources in Azure we use ARM or Bicep templates. Good to know there is also is a sort of ‘in place’-template available for AVD. This is the VM template and stored under the host pool information. In this blog post, I explain how to set and use VM templates. This will help you with the AVD sessionhost automation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to deal with AVD session hosts version management</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/how-to-deal-with-avd-session-hosts-version-management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/how-to-deal-with-avd-session-hosts-version-management/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Shared Image Gallery is a great way to distribute images over multiple environments.
