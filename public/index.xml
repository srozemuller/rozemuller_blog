      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I got asked to preconfigure an start menu for end users.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My first approach was deploying a start menu using the settings catalog in Intune. This works great but disadvantage using the settings catalog is that a user has no option to create an own start menu.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The start menu will be overwritten by the Intune policy. That was not the goal for our project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to run proactive remediation scripts automatically during the Windows Autopilot enrollment process in Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely noticed that the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this by default. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to work around this limitation using Azure Functions, making your Autopilot deployments even smoother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Intune becomes more and more important in the modern workplace. It is used to manage devices, applications, and users. More and more resources are available in Intune. To make resources work, you need to assign them. Finding assignments in Intune is a hard job. Another thing is that resources consist of settings, think about configuration profiles, compliance policies, and more.&#xA;To get more insights into Microsoft Intune assignments, the configured settings and more, I created a tool to help you with this. The tool is called Intune Assistant.&#xA;In this blog post, I will show you what Intune Assistant is and how it can help you with your daily work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Universal Print is a cloud-based print solution that organizations can use to manage their print infrastructure through the Microsoft 365 cloud. Universal Print can also be managed through Intune.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I show how to create Intune configuration policies based on Universal Print in an automated way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing settings and updates in Microsoft Intune is a good idea. Many Intune administrators use a test group and Deployment Rings for this. In the case of Windows Updates, administrators configure an update ring and assign a group to it. The group is filled with devices (I call it a device group).&#xA;In this blog post, I will show you how to dynamically manage a device group in an automated way for your Intune update rings based on&#xA;a user group. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it dynamic device group management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Single Sign On (SSO) for Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) gives users a seamless login experience from their Windows 10 or Windows 11 device to AVD. This feature is available for a while and most people have configured this feature already. Also, most are also using Conditional Access (CA) (I hope). To make Single Sign On work for AVD in combination with CA policies you need to add the applications &lt;code&gt;Microsoft Remote Desktop (a4a365df-50f1-4397-bc59-1a1564b8bb9c)&lt;/code&gt; to your CA policies. Based on your situation the applications are in- or excluded.&#xA;Now, Microsoft announced that the Single Sign On traffic will be transitioned from the &lt;code&gt;Microsoft Remote Desktop&lt;/code&gt; app to &lt;code&gt;Windows Cloud Login&lt;/code&gt;. This means you have to add this application to your CA policies. This can be done manually, but I prefer to automate this. In this blog post, I will show you how to add the &lt;code&gt;Windows Cloud Login&lt;/code&gt; application to your CA policies automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you heard of it before, Graph API. It is the platform where many Microsoft Services are connected to. Think about Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, SharePoint and many more. If you want to automate things regarding these services, it’s the way to talk against the Graph API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has updated their security baselines in Microsoft Intune which you can read in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/whats-new#updated-security-baseline-for-windows-version-23h2&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;What is new in Intune&lt;/a&gt;. A part of the updates is that Microsoft has added recommended settings based on your organisation. In this blog post, I show how to monitor these recommendations that are part of the security baseline and generate a response when a setting does not met Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the clipboard between Azure Virtual Desktop and the users client is a great way to send data back and forth. But it is also could big leak into the system. So maybe you want to limit the use of the clipboard or get more control on how the clipboard could be used between the user and the Azure Virtual Desktop enviroment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a question on X (Twitter) where someone was looking for a way to filter for a specific Azure Virtual Desktop assigned user using the Azure management API. For some reason, the filter option is not working in this API. Where in the end it was not possible to find the correct user directly from an API request.&#xA;In this post, I show a different, also more efficient way, to find the correct user assigned to an Azure Virtual Desktop session host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Managing Intune can be challenging, especially when having multiple Microsoft Intune environments. Because of that, I started project IntuneAssistant. A part of the project is a CLI tool that can run as a daemon in your own environment.&#xA;In this small blog, I explain how to use the CLI and what are my thoughts for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you also may know is that using filters in Intune is a best practise. With the come of the Windows 11 23H2 build number it is a good idea 💡 to update your filters by adding the new 10.22631.x build number. In this blog post, I show how to update all Windows 11 filters with the new build number using PowerShell and the Graph API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Windows Store App feature (aka WinGet installation) becomes more popular. However, this feature is still in preview. That means that not all is working as expected. Adding these applications using the portal has dependencies. One of those things is that an applications needs a valid version. Something not every application has.&#xA;The results in an error like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autoscaling for pooled AVD host pools is GA for a while now. Since 18 July 2023 a new autoscale mechanism became in Public Preview for AVD &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt; host pools.&#xA;Currently it is only supported to configure autoscale for personal host pools by using the portal. There are no API&amp;rsquo;s or PowerShell modules available (yet) to automate the creation or mutating personal scaling plans or schedules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another big helper in implementing a Zero Trust environment is the use of Privileged Identity Management, aka PIM. It is a best practice assigning the least permissions as needed for the shortest amount of time. PIM helps you with that.&#xA;After implementing PIM you have left-overs of admins assign roles to identities without PIM. In that case there is a mechanism that check if there are roles assign outside PIM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing conditional access policies have a huge impact on your identities and organisation. After implementation, there could be a situation conditional policies need changes. Think about the state, adding or excluding users, or adding a security strength for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier posts I created several conditional access policies in an automated way. During the time policies may change, users will be added to a specific Azure role, groups are added and so many more.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;All those changes effect on how conditional access policies act. Because of that, it is recommended to check your conditional access policies environment so now and then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emergency accounts are a fundamental part of any security strategy. They are used to access systems when the primary account is unavailable or locked out. In the past, emergency accounts were often called “break glass” accounts. In an earlier post, I explained &lt;a href=&#34;../configure-break-glass-accounts-infrastructure-automated/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;how to create an emergency account based on a user account with a password&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier steps, I explained how to control identity and devices to connect to your environment. Now people are connected to your environment safely, the next step is to make sure your data won&amp;rsquo;t walk out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this step of the Zero to Zero Trust journey we will look at the first step of how to keep your data safe. In this blog, I show how to automate the creation of App Protection Policies. Intune App Protection policies help protect corporate data even if a device itself is not managed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd step in the series Zero to Zero Trust in an automated way. In the previous steps, we configured an emergency account and protected the account with conditional access policies. The conditional access policies control the log-in process. In this step, we configure access policies for other users and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identities are the key to environments and must be configured as securely as possible. To achieve this goal, conditional access policies are indispensable. In this blog post, I show how to secure privileged accounts that need more attention than MFA only. This post shows how to configure Zero Trust conditional access policies in an automated way.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is the next step in our Zero to Zero Trust journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays a good cloud environment has strict security policies. Well-known policies are conditional access policies. Policies that require a compliant device before login for example or forcing MFA. Configuring conditional access is good but there is always a risk of lockout yourself. To not lock yourself out, you must create an emergency account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Microsoft redesigned the company branding functionality. That means you have more flexibility in the main layout, full-screen background image for example. But also the ability to change the header, footer and even link relating to self-service password reset, privacy &amp;amp; cookies or Terms of Use.&#xA;Also, there is an option to upload a CSS style sheet to change colors, buttons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; Win32Lob Graph API has no object available to store a file in, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/intune-apps-win32lobapp-create?view=graph-rest-beta&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain how to upload files while creating Win32Lob applications automated.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That decided me to look into the file upload process and write this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It looks like Microsoft has added a new option that allows users to create tenants. Some people have seen the Tenant Creation option in the regular Azure portal but was removed fast. For now, the option is still available in the Preview Azure Portal (&lt;a href=&#34;https://preview.portal.azure.com/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;https://preview.portal.azure.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a situation where a customer asked me how to make sure the AVD environment always has the same WAN IP. To give Azure Virtual Desktop a fixed external IP, some options are available. Think about a NAT gateway or an Azure Firewall. In this blog post, I show how to configure a static WAN IP for AVD with the use of the Azure Firewall in an automated way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In that post, I explained how to authenticate to the &lt;code&gt;https://main.iam.ad.ext.azure.com/api/&lt;/code&gt; endpoint and, how to get information from it. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I would suggest reading that post first.&#xA;I used Azure Functions to run the automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know the Graph API, graph.microsoft.com, and the Azure management API, management.azure.com. Both APIs are used very often and lots of automation tasks depend on those APIs. Also, most PowerShell modules rely on them and, the Graph and Azure management APIs are well documented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conditional access is an indispensable configuration setting in Azure AD. Conditional Access policies are in basic if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it. Or, it requires everyone to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication can be a password in combination with an SMS or the use of the Microsoft Authenticator app for example.&#xA;In the past, a user can choose to use SMS or the authenticator or what the admins provide you to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In automation using templates is key! Using templates makes life easier. No new information I guess. If you run tasks in DevOps, Terraform, or other engines you want to reuse code blocks. When deploying resources in Azure we use ARM or Bicep templates. Good to know there is also is a sort of ‘in place’-template available for AVD. This is the VM template and stored under the host pool information. In this blog post, I explain how to set and use VM templates. This will help you with the AVD sessionhost automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Shared Image Gallery is a great way to distribute images over multiple environments. This great feature is also its disadvantage. When using a Shared Image Gallery in combination with several environments with even more host pools you will lose sight fast. At this moment there is no good overview of which host in which environment is using which version.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this article, I will explain how to deal with AVD session hosts and version management. This will help to keep your environment clean and save costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is very common to use a golden image in Azure Virtual Desktop environments. Some are using Azure images, others are using a Shared Image Gallery. A great advantage of using preconfigured images is that you just have to create a new session host from that image and you’re all set.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rozemuller.com/create-avd-image-version-based-on-existing-config-with-powershell/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;change process&lt;/a&gt; for an image version is very simple, you will start a virtual machine from the version and you will make the changes. But what if you need to change the OS disk size of the golden image? In this article, I will explain how to change an Azure Virtual Desktop disk size when using a golden image based on the existing environment automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my travel the past year in the world of AVD I noticed I’m using the common Az.DesktopVirtualization PowerShell module very often, but there are some limits. In basics they do their job but if you like more intelligence or add more resource types you will need to combine PowerShell commands to get useful information. That’s the point where I started writing a AVD PowerShell module and now it is time to share my functions as a fresh new module called Az.Avd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Costs are a topic of an Azure conversation very often. As we all know you pay for usage, if it is storage, CPU or bandwidth usage, (almost) every resource has its price. For Windows Virtual Desktop it means you have to pay for CPU usage, for example. It is important then to keep this usage as low as possible. Now there is an option to keep these usage as low as possible with AVD Start VM on Connect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in earlier posts Azure DevOps is a really nice way to deploy Azure resources automated. During my travel through Azure DevOps for managing Windows Virtual Desktop resources I moved from classic pipelines and releases to the new YAML pipelines. Using YAML has a lot of advantages in relation to classic. But there are some new challenges coming, approval or manual interventions for example. In this article I will explain how to use approvals and checks with dynamic recipients in DevOps environments within a YAML configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working remotely has a lot of advantages like less travel time, more focus to work (when the house is not full of kids :)), which contributes to working efficiently. But there are some concerns about security, and rightly so I think. Especially when you are used to ‘see’ what happens on the screen in real life which help at least you think you are in control of your data. In this article I will show how to enable AVD screen protection automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By default the Azure Key Vault has softdelete enabled with a 90 day retention. This option will protect Key Vault items when deleted by accident. When deleted you are able to restore that item through the portal or PowerShell.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But what if someone has deleted the Key Vault itself with all the items and softdeleted items included. There is no option to restore a Key Vault. In this article I will describe a way how to backup and restore a Key Vault when deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When using the Azure Virtual Desktop for a longer time and created images several times you will noticed you are not able to remove old images directly when a new version has been deployed. Or in case of a MSP when you need to manage more then one image after some time you will lose sight on images and versions. An image overview would be nice to have. In this article I will show how to do some image version control on a AVD environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Azure KeyVault is the security key management system in Azure where you can store keys, secrets and certificates. From that place you can use the items everywhere you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details class=&#34;table-of-content&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;summary&gt;Table Of Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;  &lt;nav id=&#34;TableOfContents&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&#xA;      &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-main-idea&#34;&gt;The main idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#why-using-certificates&#34;&gt;Why using certificates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#download-certificates-from-keyvault&#34;&gt;Download certificates from KeyVault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-foreach-loop&#34;&gt;The foreach loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#devops&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/nav&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-main-idea&#34;&gt;The main idea&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We using the certificates thumbprint for connecting to an Azure AD.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You have some Microsoft 365 (M365) customers which you like to monitor. Every day you are looking at the customer specific M365 portal looking for Microsoft event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Logging in &lt;/mark&gt;at the&lt;mark&gt; customers portal isn’t a very efficient way.&lt;/mark&gt; &lt;mark&gt;Microsoft provides a lot of API’s which can be used for monitoring.&lt;/mark&gt; By combining some of them you are able to do some really nice and smart things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this first part, I will describe how to create and connect a new disk (based on a snapshot) to a new Azure VM based on the existing sessionhost configuration. This will save a lot of extra parameters like VM size, network settings, and type. After the VM is started you will get the information on how to connect to the VM by RDP (3389) with specific credentials specially created for this VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
