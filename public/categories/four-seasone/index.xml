      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just told you! You&amp;rsquo;ve killed me! Do a flip! I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! It&amp;rsquo;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Calculon is gonna kill us and it&amp;rsquo;s all everybody else&amp;rsquo;s fault!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hello Morbo, how&amp;rsquo;s the family? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought &amp;ldquo;Why should I?&amp;rdquo; Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
