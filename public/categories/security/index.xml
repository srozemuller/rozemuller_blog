      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier posts I created several conditional access policies in an automated way. During the time policies may change, users will be added to a specific Azure role, groups are added and so many more.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;All those changes effect on how conditional access policies act. Because of that, it is recommended to check your conditional access policies environment so now and then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emergency accounts are a fundamental part of any security strategy. They are used to access systems when the primary account is unavailable or locked out. In the past, emergency accounts were often called “break glass” accounts. In an earlier post, I explained &lt;a href=&#34;../configure-break-glass-accounts-infrastructure-automated/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;how to create an emergency account based on a user account with a password&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I will show you how to automate the creation of a passwordless, multi-layered emergency account using Graph API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier steps, I explained how to control identity and devices to connect to your environment. Now people are connected to your environment safely, the next step is to make sure your data won&amp;rsquo;t walk out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this step of the Zero to Zero Trust journey we will look at the first step of how to keep your data safe. In this blog, I show how to automate the creation of App Protection Policies. Intune App Protection policies help protect corporate data even if a device itself is not managed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd step in the series Zero to Zero Trust in an automated way. In the previous steps, we configured an emergency account and protected the account with conditional access policies. The conditional access policies control the log-in process. In this step, we configure access policies for other users and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identities are the key to environments and must be configured as securely as possible. To achieve this goal, conditional access policies are indispensable. In this blog post, I show how to secure privileged accounts that need more attention than MFA only. This post shows how to configure Zero Trust conditional access policies in an automated way.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is the next step in our Zero to Zero Trust journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configure Break Glass Accounts Infrastructure Automated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays a good cloud environment has strict security policies. Well-known policies are conditional access policies. Policies that require a compliant device before login for example or forcing MFA. Configuring conditional access is good but there is always a risk of lockout yourself. To not lock yourself out, you must create an emergency account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Zero to Zero Trust series automated and to this automation index. In this series, I will show the process from a zero security configuration to Zero Trust in the Microsoft public cloud. The series passes all the important items and show how to configure the components automated if applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Get Intune Device Management Scripts Content using Graph</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/get-intune-device-management-scripts-content-using-graph/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/get-intune-device-management-scripts-content-using-graph/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Device management scripts in Intune are custom scripts that can run on Windows 10 and higher clients and  MacOS. The ability to run scripts on local devices gives you an alternative to configuring devices with settings that are not available under the configuration policies or in the apps part of Intune.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disable user tenant creation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It looks like Microsoft has added a new option that allows users to create tenants. Some people have seen the Tenant Creation option in the regular Azure portal but was removed fast. For now, the option is still available in the Preview Azure Portal (&lt;a href=&#34;https://preview.portal.azure.com/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;https://preview.portal.azure.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploy and monitor conditional access authentication strength automated</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/deploy-monitor-conditional-access-require-authentication-strength/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conditional access is an indispensable configuration setting in Azure AD. Conditional Access policies are in basic if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it. Or, it requires everyone to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication can be a password in combination with an SMS or the use of the Microsoft Authenticator app for example.&#xA;In the past, a user can choose to use SMS or the authenticator or what the admins provide you to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I show how to deploy an AVD session host with the Trusted Launch, secure boot and vTPM. This option is now Generally Available. I show how to deploy the AVD session host with the REST API and with the Az.Avd PowerShell module from a Compute Gallery image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Azure tenant is the Microsoft public cloud base. It is very important to keep your bases as secure as possible. To keep your tenant secure, Microsoft provides actions that give you insights into your tenant’s security and how to improve it. In this blog, I show how to monitor the secure score security improvement action status.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monitor security baselines in Endpoint Security</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/monitor-security-baselines-in-endpoint-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A security baseline has some values which are interesting to know. It has a status that tells us the current deployment status if a profile is assigned or is deprecated. In this post, I show how to monitor security baselines. The current status, versions, and if a profile is assigned. I will explain which data is important, how to get the data and show different ways to send alerts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/microsoft-endpoint-manager-security-baselines-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During writing automation blog posts about deploying security baselines automated, I felt the need to write a new blog about how these security baselines actually work. Not in the way how security baselines are deployed but how security baselines are built. Which components does a baseline have and how do settings fit together. In this blog post, I peel off a security baseline and explain how to grab the correct settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Security became important more and more. It is recommend, now the days arrived where the most people work from home and IT is moving to the public cloud, to use a good firewall with less complexity as possible. In case of AVD within the current situation an IT environment can be complex. In this article I will explain how configure an Azure Firewall for AVD automated with premium options, which came in public preview at 16 February 2021. At the end I will show how to deploy an Azure Firewall specially for a AVD environment with all the needed steps automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working remotely has a lot of advantages like less travel time, more focus to work (when the house is not full of kids :)), which contributes to working efficiently. But there are some concerns about security, and rightly so I think. Especially when you are used to ‘see’ what happens on the screen in real life which help at least you think you are in control of your data. In this article I will show how to enable AVD screen protection automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
