During my travel through Azure DevOps for managing Windows Virtual Desktop resources I moved from classic pipelines and releases to the new YAML pipelines. Using YAML has a lot of advantages in relation to classic. But there are some new challenges coming, approval or manual interventions for example.

Before you are able to deploy resources into Azure with pipelines you will need to setup a project and a service connection first. In post I will explain how to create a DevOps Service Connection the automated way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prepare Azure DevOps for Azure Virtual Desktop deployment – Create DevOps project</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/prepare-azure-devops-for-azure-virtual-desktop-deployment-create-devops-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 16:02:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/prepare-azure-devops-for-azure-virtual-desktop-deployment-create-devops-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>An Azure DevOps environment consists of projects. Before create anything in DevOps like a board, repositories or pipelines you first need a project. In this second part of the series Prepare Azure DevOps for Azure Virtual Desktop we are diving into that DevOps part, a project. At the end of this post you will be able to deploy WVD with DevOps automated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
