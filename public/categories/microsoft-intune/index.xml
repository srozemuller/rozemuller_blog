Many Intune administrators use a test group and Deployment Rings for this. In the case of Windows Updates, administrators configure an update ring and assign a group to it. The group is filled with devices (I call it a device group).
In this blog post, I will show you how to dynamically manage a device group in an automated way for your Intune update rings based on
a user group. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it dynamic device group management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monitor Security Baseline Insights Recommendations</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/monitor-security-baseline-insights-recommendations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 16:28:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/monitor-security-baseline-insights-recommendations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft has updated their security baselines in Microsoft Intune which you can read in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/whats-new#updated-security-baseline-for-windows-version-23h2"
