>my post about using the hidden API in automation&lt;/a>
. In that post, I explained how to authenticate to the &lt;code>https://main.iam.ad.ext.azure.com/api/&lt;/code> endpoint and, how to get information from it. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I would suggest reading that post first.
I used Azure Functions to run the automation tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use internal main.iam.ad API in automation</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/use-internal-azure-api-in-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 11:46:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/use-internal-azure-api-in-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all know the Graph API, graph.microsoft.com, and the Azure management API, management.azure.com.

Conditional Access policies are in basic if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to do multi-factor authentication to access it. Or, it requires everyone to use multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication can be a password in combination with an SMS or the use of the Microsoft Authenticator app for example.
In the past, a user can choose to use SMS or the authenticator or what the admins provide you to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploy and monitor conditional access authentication strength automated</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/deploy-monitor-conditional-access-require-authentication-strength/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 11:46:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/deploy-monitor-conditional-access-require-authentication-strength/</guid><description>&lt;p>Conditional access is an indispensable configuration setting in Azure AD.
