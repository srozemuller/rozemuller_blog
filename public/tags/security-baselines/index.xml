It has a status that tells us the current deployment status if a profile is assigned or is deprecated. In this post, I show how to monitor security baselines. The current status, versions, and if a profile is assigned. I will explain which data is important, how to get the data and show different ways to send alerts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microsoft Intune security baselines explained</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/microsoft-endpoint-manager-security-baselines-explained/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 16:09:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/microsoft-endpoint-manager-security-baselines-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p>During writing automation blog posts about deploying security baselines automated, I felt the need to write a new blog about how these security baselines actually work. Not in the way how security baselines are deployed but how security baselines are built. Which components does a baseline have and how do settings fit together. In this blog post, I peel off a security baseline and explain how to grab the correct settings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
