But it is also could big leak into the system. So maybe you want to limit the use of the clipboard or get more control on how the clipboard could be used between the user and the Azure Virtual Desktop enviroment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configure AVD using settings catalog automated</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/configure-avd-using-settings-catalog-automated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 20:14:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/configure-avd-using-settings-catalog-automated/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to this blog about configuring Azure Virtual Desktop session host with Microsoft Intune.

Private becomes public, local resources are moving to the public cloud. More and more workloads return to the local endpoint. Cloud endpoints (AVD, W365) are mostly used to run legacy software.
With all those movements, it could be challenging to keep the herd in the pasture. Devices are everywhere and what about security?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enroll Defender For Endpoint automated</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/monitor-intune-using-azure-functions-powershell-and-graph-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:12:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/monitor-intune-using-azure-functions-powershell-and-graph-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure"
