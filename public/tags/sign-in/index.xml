      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Microsoft redesigned the company branding functionality. That means you have more flexibility in the main layout, full-screen background image for example. But also the ability to change the header, footer and even link relating to self-service password reset, privacy &amp;amp; cookies or Terms of Use.&#xA;Also, there is an option to upload a CSS style sheet to change colors, buttons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
