      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I got asked to preconfigure an start menu for end users.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My first approach was deploying a start menu using the settings catalog in Intune. This works great but disadvantage using the settings catalog is that a user has no option to create an own start menu.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The start menu will be overwritten by the Intune policy. That was not the goal for our project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to run proactive remediation scripts automatically during the Windows Autopilot enrollment process in Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely noticed that the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this by default. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to work around this limitation using Azure Functions, making your Autopilot deployments even smoother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Intune becomes more and more important in the modern workplace. It is used to manage devices, applications, and users. More and more resources are available in Intune. To make resources work, you need to assign them. Finding assignments in Intune is a hard job. Another thing is that resources consist of settings, think about configuration profiles, compliance policies, and more.&#xA;To get more insights into Microsoft Intune assignments, the configured settings and more, I created a tool to help you with this. The tool is called Intune Assistant.&#xA;In this blog post, I will show you what Intune Assistant is and how it can help you with your daily work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Universal Print is a cloud-based print solution that organizations can use to manage their print infrastructure through the Microsoft 365 cloud. Universal Print can also be managed through Intune.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I show how to create Intune configuration policies based on Universal Print in an automated way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the clipboard between Azure Virtual Desktop and the users client is a great way to send data back and forth. But it is also could big leak into the system. So maybe you want to limit the use of the clipboard or get more control on how the clipboard could be used between the user and the Azure Virtual Desktop enviroment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a question on X (Twitter) where someone was looking for a way to filter for a specific Azure Virtual Desktop assigned user using the Azure management API. For some reason, the filter option is not working in this API. Where in the end it was not possible to find the correct user directly from an API request.&#xA;In this post, I show a different, also more efficient way, to find the correct user assigned to an Azure Virtual Desktop session host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Managing Intune can be challenging, especially when having multiple Microsoft Intune environments. Because of that, I started project IntuneAssistant. A part of the project is a CLI tool that can run as a daemon in your own environment.&#xA;In this small blog, I explain how to use the CLI and what are my thoughts for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you also may know is that using filters in Intune is a best practise. With the come of the Windows 11 23H2 build number it is a good idea 💡 to update your filters by adding the new 10.22631.x build number. In this blog post, I show how to update all Windows 11 filters with the new build number using PowerShell and the Graph API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Windows Store App feature (aka WinGet installation) becomes more popular. However, this feature is still in preview. That means that not all is working as expected. Adding these applications using the portal has dependencies. One of those things is that an applications needs a valid version. Something not every application has.&#xA;The results in an error like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autoscaling for pooled AVD host pools is GA for a while now. Since 18 July 2023 a new autoscale mechanism became in Public Preview for AVD &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt; host pools.&#xA;Currently it is only supported to configure autoscale for personal host pools by using the portal. There are no API&amp;rsquo;s or PowerShell modules available (yet) to automate the creation or mutating personal scaling plans or schedules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know there is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.com/invite/msems&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;Microsoft EMS Community&lt;/a&gt; Discord channel where we help out eachother. Recently there was a question about how to import certificate file as reusable setting in Endpoint Privilege Management using the Graph API. Together with Steven van Beek we answered that question on how to bulk import certificates using the Graph API. To also help others I like to share the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another big helper in implementing a Zero Trust environment is the use of Privileged Identity Management, aka PIM. It is a best practice assigning the least permissions as needed for the shortest amount of time. PIM helps you with that.&#xA;After implementing PIM you have left-overs of admins assign roles to identities without PIM. In that case there is a mechanism that check if there are roles assign outside PIM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing conditional access policies have a huge impact on your identities and organisation. After implementation, there could be a situation conditional policies need changes. Think about the state, adding or excluding users, or adding a security strength for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier posts I created several conditional access policies in an automated way. During the time policies may change, users will be added to a specific Azure role, groups are added and so many more.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;All those changes effect on how conditional access policies act. Because of that, it is recommended to check your conditional access policies environment so now and then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emergency accounts are a fundamental part of any security strategy. They are used to access systems when the primary account is unavailable or locked out. In the past, emergency accounts were often called “break glass” accounts. In an earlier post, I explained &lt;a href=&#34;../configure-break-glass-accounts-infrastructure-automated/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;how to create an emergency account based on a user account with a password&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I will show you how to automate the creation of a passwordless, multi-layered emergency account using Graph API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In earlier steps, I explained how to control identity and devices to connect to your environment. Now people are connected to your environment safely, the next step is to make sure your data won&amp;rsquo;t walk out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this step of the Zero to Zero Trust journey we will look at the first step of how to keep your data safe. In this blog, I show how to automate the creation of App Protection Policies. Intune App Protection policies help protect corporate data even if a device itself is not managed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd step in the series Zero to Zero Trust in an automated way. In the previous steps, we configured an emergency account and protected the account with conditional access policies. The conditional access policies control the log-in process. In this step, we configure access policies for other users and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identities are the key to environments and must be configured as securely as possible. To achieve this goal, conditional access policies are indispensable. In this blog post, I show how to secure privileged accounts that need more attention than MFA only. This post shows how to configure Zero Trust conditional access policies in an automated way.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is the next step in our Zero to Zero Trust journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays a good cloud environment has strict security policies. Well-known policies are conditional access policies. Policies that require a compliant device before login for example or forcing MFA. Configuring conditional access is good but there is always a risk of lockout yourself. To not lock yourself out, you must create an emergency account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, Microsoft Intune has a reporting platform where lots of information is stored. Think about device management or endpoint analytics. For troubleshooting, reports can help. However, if you need to troubleshoot you are too late in the first place. It would be nice to get alerts out of Microsoft Intune. Luckily, there are options to achieve that goal. In this post, I show a way to monitor and get alerts from Microsoft Intune.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During writing automation blog posts about deploying security baselines automated, I felt the need to write a new blog about how these security baselines actually work. Not in the way how security baselines are deployed but how security baselines are built. Which components does a baseline have and how do settings fit together. In this blog post, I peel off a security baseline and explain how to grab the correct settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I explain how to distribute OneDrive with Microsoft Endpoint Managed based on Winget. After deploying OneDrive I configure a settings catalog configuration policy. This policy has all the OneDrive best practices. At last, a sync device is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will show how to install applications with Windows Package Manager (or Winget), within Microsft Endpoint Manager. This is all done by one single executable package which accepts the application name and version. Or providing a manifest location. Using one single file avoids creating single packages and intunewin-files every time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome (back) to the AVD Automation Cocktail. In the past &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rozemuller.com/avd-automation-cocktail-the-menu&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;cocktail series&lt;/a&gt;, I showed different AVD deployment strategies and languages. During the time I got some requests about automation with Terraform. In this cocktail, The Dutch Bloody Harry, I’ll show you how to deploy an AVD environment automated with Terraform Cloud and Github. I’m using the Terraform cloud combined with my GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using VM templates for AVD sessionhost automation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In automation using templates is key! Using templates makes life easier. No new information I guess. If you run tasks in DevOps, Terraform, or other engines you want to reuse code blocks. When deploying resources in Azure we use ARM or Bicep templates. Good to know there is also is a sort of ‘in place’-template available for AVD. This is the VM template and stored under the host pool information. In this blog post, I explain how to set and use VM templates. This will help you with the AVD sessionhost automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Shared Image Gallery is a great way to distribute images over multiple environments. This great feature is also its disadvantage. When using a Shared Image Gallery in combination with several environments with even more host pools you will lose sight fast. At this moment there is no good overview of which host in which environment is using which version.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this article, I will explain how to deal with AVD session hosts and version management. This will help to keep your environment clean and save costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the Windows 11 launch everyone was waiting till Windows 11 came available in Azure. Since the 19th of August Windows 11 became in preview. I decided to test it in a AVD environment. Because it is not a next-next-finish installation I will explain how to deploy Windows 11 in an AVD environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is very common to use a golden image in Azure Virtual Desktop environments. Some are using Azure images, others are using a Shared Image Gallery. A great advantage of using preconfigured images is that you just have to create a new session host from that image and you’re all set.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rozemuller.com/create-avd-image-version-based-on-existing-config-with-powershell/&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&gt;change process&lt;/a&gt; for an image version is very simple, you will start a virtual machine from the version and you will make the changes. But what if you need to change the OS disk size of the golden image? In this article, I will explain how to change an Azure Virtual Desktop disk size when using a golden image based on the existing environment automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in earlier posts Azure DevOps is a really nice way to deploy Azure resources automated. During my travel through Azure DevOps for managing Windows Virtual Desktop resources I moved from classic pipelines and releases to the new YAML pipelines. Using YAML has a lot of advantages in relation to classic. But there are some new challenges coming, approval or manual interventions for example. In this article I will explain how to use approvals and checks with dynamic recipients in DevOps environments within a YAML configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Azure DevOps environment consists of projects. Before create anything in DevOps like a board, repositories or pipelines you first need a project. In this second part of the series Prepare Azure DevOps for Azure Virtual Desktop we are diving into that DevOps part, a project. At the end of this post you will be able to deploy WVD with DevOps automated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Azure Virtual Desktop is generally available a lot of improvements has been done. Think about ARM template deployment, MSIX app attach through the Azure portal and performance improvements in the AVD client and latency improvements at the most of the regions.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Since 16 November 2020 a nice improvement has been added to the list, Azure Virtual Desktop RDP Short path. In this blogpost I will show you how to enable RDP Shortpath in AVD with some automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
