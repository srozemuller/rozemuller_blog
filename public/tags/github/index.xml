      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know WordPress. It is a good platform for running websites with almost every purpose. Since the start of this blog, I also used WordPress. It has a lot of templates and plug-ins available. For me running this blog on WordPress was good enough. Now a few years later it became more a frustration than a pleasure to keep my website up and running. In this blog, I explain why and how I changed my website into a static webpage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
