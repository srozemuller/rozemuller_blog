Many Intune administrators use a test group and Deployment Rings for this. In the case of Windows Updates, administrators configure an update ring and assign a group to it. The group is filled with devices (I call it a device group).
In this blog post, I will show you how to dynamically manage a device group in an automated way for your Intune update rings based on
a user group. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it dynamic device group management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Delete AAD and Intune devices based on CSV and Graph API</title><link>https://www.rozemuller.com/delete-aad-intune-devices-based-on-csv-and-graph-api/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 10:52:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.rozemuller.com/delete-aad-intune-devices-based-on-csv-and-graph-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>The power of community is to collaborate and help others achieve goals. In this case, I got a question from a good community friend to help write a script that removes over 6000 devices from Intune and Azure Active Directory. The base is a CSV file filled with Intune devices IDs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
