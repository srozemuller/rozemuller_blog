Welcome to **The Intune Automation Tasting** — a MEMBEER-inspired series where we build Intune automation like a proper tasting session: we start light and safe, then gradually increase complexity and power.

The goal isn’t automation for automation’s sake.  
The goal is **control**, **confidence**, and **repeatability** — without turning your tenant into a science experiment.

## Why this series exists

If you manage Intune long enough, you’ll run into the same pain points:

- you lack a complete overview of what’s configured
- comparing policies is time-consuming
- changes happen manually and drift builds up over time
- reporting and monitoring doesn’t scale with “clicking”
- you want automation, but permissions/authentication feel like a barrier

This series gives you a clear path from beginner to advanced, using patterns you can actually apply in real tenants.

## The tasting menu (automation levels)

Each “style” represents a maturity level. You don’t need to jump to the strongest brew on day one.

### 🍺 Session Lager — Foundations
Light, safe, and beginner-friendly.  
Identity, permissions, authentication, and read-only patterns.

### 🍺 Pale Ale — Practical automation
More flavor, still approachable.  
Exporting data, structuring responses, and building useful tools.

### 🍺 IPA — Insight & scale
Bolder and more opinionated.  
Reporting, drift detection, comparisons, monitoring and alerting.

### 🍺 Double IPA / Stout — Controlled change automation
Full-bodied and powerful.  
Write automation, guardrails, approvals, and “desired state” thinking.

## What you’ll need

This series assumes:
- you have basic Intune knowledge (policies, assignments, device groups)
- you’re willing to start slow: read-only first, controlled change later

If you’re brand new to Graph, no worries — we build that foundation early.

## Start here

If you’re new, start with the intro and Part 1. They set the mindset and prevent the most common mistakes.
[The Intune Automation Tasting - First Sip](../intune-automation-tasting-first-sip/)

## Want to follow along?

I’ll keep adding new “tasting rounds” as we move from foundations to advanced automation.  
If you have a specific automation goal (reporting, exporting, drift detection, assignments, remediation), send it to me — I’ll shape future parts around real-world needs.
