# Welcome to **The Intune Automation Tasting** 🍺

Automation doesn’t have to be intimidating. This series is your guide to mastering **Microsoft Intune automation** step by step — inspired by the art of a proper tasting session. We’ll start light and safe, then gradually build up to full-bodied, powerful automation.

---

## **Why Join This Journey?**

Managing Intune can feel overwhelming. Common challenges include:

- Lack of a complete overview of configurations
- Manual changes leading to drift over time
- Time-consuming policy comparisons
- Reporting and monitoring that doesn’t scale
- Barriers to automation like permissions and authentication

This series is designed to solve these pain points with practical, real-world patterns you can apply in your own environment.



## **The Tasting Menu**

Each level represents a step in your automation journey. Start where you’re comfortable and grow at your own pace.

### 🍺 **Session Lager — Foundations**
Light, safe, and beginner-friendly.  
Focus: Overviews, Identity, permissions, authentication, and read-only patterns.

- [The Intune Automation Tasting - First Sip](/series/intune-automation-tasting-first-sip/)
### 🍺 **Pale Ale — Practical Automation**
More flavor, still approachable.  
Focus: Exporting data, structuring responses, and building useful tools.

### 🍺 **IPA — Insight & Scale**
Bolder and more opinionated.  
Focus: Reporting, drift detection, comparisons, monitoring, and alerting.

### 🍺 **Double IPA / Stout — Controlled Change Automation**
Full-bodied and powerful.  
Focus: Write automation, guardrails, approvals, and “desired state” thinking.


## **What You’ll Need**

To follow along, you’ll need:

- Basic knowledge of Intune (policies, assignments, device groups)
- A willingness to start slow: read-only first, controlled change later

If you’re new to Microsoft Graph, don’t worry — we’ll build that foundation early.

## **Start Here**

Ready to begin? Start with the introduction and **Part 1** to set the mindset and avoid common pitfalls:
